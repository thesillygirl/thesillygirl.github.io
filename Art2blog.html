We all have heard the most famous motivational dialogue mentioned by our parents that “This is it, beta you have to give your 100% in class 12 because this will define the way your future prospects are shaped and get you in a good college”. In Class 12, each and every student in our country pours their heart into preparing for boards and studies hard for getting admission in their dream colleges. When we finally make our dream turn into reality after battling the skyrocketing cutoffs, we all aspire to reap the fruit of our hard work and enjoy our college life but this bubble bursted when we were hit by the reality of this pandemic and forced to pursue college from our homes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This one and a half year with the pandemic has turned the world upside down and students have encountered many challenges due to this and are still facing it head on. Education is the one thing that empowers us and gives us wings to fly but when due to certain reasons, this domain has to transform itself in a diversified and populous country like India; it is not easy to ensure optimal functioning and deal with the unanticipated changes. The crystal clear digital divide is the main problem in concern to the online education.
                        </p>

                                                <p>

                                     sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" alt="">
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            Adapting to this new digital era has been challenging for both the teachers as well as the students. There are many hindrances which may make it difficult for us to adapt to the new normal such as data costs, network issues in different areas, lack of smartphones, dealing with a tough time personally, increased screen time, technological literacy etc. Despite all of this, we are confronting this situation and doing our best to cope up with it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <u><b>Pros of online classes:</b></u> 
Every coin has two sides and we can say that these online classes have really shown us how flexible and accommodating we are to changes even though it is tough. Online learning has really helped in avoiding the daily hassle of travelling to schools or colleges and we can take our classes at the utmost comfortable place - our home. It also provides an edge to the students who are introverts and are intimidated by the social atmosphere of the classes as they can comfortably attend classes without stepping out of their comfort zones. This situation has also encouraged the teachers to adjust their teaching methods and innovate to impart the education efficiently.

                            
                        </p>

                        <img src="images/thumbs/masonry/Art2Pic/2nd.jpg" 
                            
                                     sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" alt="">
                        </p>
                        <p>
Online courses and trainings have gained a lot of importance due to this pandemic as a large amount of students are trying new courses and training programmes out to learn something new and different apart from the standard or traditional academics. These online courses and programmes are pretty lucrative as they not only offer self-paced learning and study materials but also one on one doubt sessions and certificates of completion of the course at an affordable price in a variety of domains. These opportunities are really helpful in gaining knowledge about a specific field in a short period of time. This may be the new future way of imparting knowledge in the coming years with more developments. </p>

                        
                        
                        <p>
                            <u><b>Cons of online classes</b></u>
There can be various drawbacks of online classes ranging from social isolation, digital divide, lack of communication and holistic development, increased screen time, proper teacher trainings etc. In India, we battle with a huge socio-economic divide and only a small portion of the population has the access to the technological resources required for online education. This puts the disadvantaged sections into a more compromising position further leading to stagnating their overall growth.
                            
                            </p>

                                   <p>
                        <img src="images/thumbs/masonry/Art2Pic/3.jpg" 
                            
                                     sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" alt="">
                        </p>




                        <p>
Online classes have created an environment of social isolation as we are not able to meet our friends, interact and grow together. The problem of digital divide is the most concerning as many students don’t have access to smartphones or stable networks to attend the classes uninterruptedly. Lack of communication and holistic development is evident due to the absence of face-to-face interaction. It also promotes rote learning and encourages more theoretical knowledge than practical knowledge. Attending classes and dealing with the mental and emotional stress of seeing our loved ones getting effected due to Covid has been the biggest stressor for the students.                            </p>


                                  <p>
                        <img src="images/thumbs/masonry/Art2Pic/4.jpg" 
                            
                                     sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" alt="">
                        </p>
                        <p>
The biggest torment with this situation is the increased screen time which is deteriorating our eyesight and impacting our mental health as we suffer from headaches very often. Another problem which is apparent is that there is no proper teacher trainings for these online classes. Most of the teachers just have a basic understanding of technology and don’t even have the necessary tools and resources to conduct the online classes. Nevertheless, we can only do our best to cope up with this situation as online classes are the only alternative available to resort to in these tough times. </p>

                        
                        <p>
                            <u><b>My experience as a DU student:</b></u>
Getting admission into Hansraj was truly a dream come true but who knew that this pandemic will limit my college to the four walls of my room. Despite this, I can say that yes if the college was offline, I would have had a whole new experience but I think that we should accept the things as they are and be grateful. So as my first year in college is coming to an end, I can say with pride that even though the situation wasn’t ideal but I tried my best to grow as an individual and make the most of my first year in college by exploring different internships, volunteering with various organizations, participating in different competitions, attending some amazing events and webinars, pursuing my passion to learn a foreign language and juggling with my college classes in between all of this. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                        <img src="images/thumbs/masonry/Art2Pic/5.jpg" 
                            
                                     sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" alt="">
                        </p>

                        <p>I have learnt and changed a lot as a person when it comes to expressing my opinions and gained new perspectives. As a fresher, I was totally clueless but with time I caught up on things. Being part of societies really helped me develop new skills and explore my interests by working in different departments of the societies. I also gained a lot of exposure and learnt how to deal with things while pursuing different internships. My volunteering experiences were also a great and memorable experience as I got to contribute to a noble cause while doing what I love.</p>

                        <p>
                        <img src="images/thumbs/masonry/Art2Pic/6.jpg" 
                            
                                     sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" alt="">
                        </p>

                        <p>The people always play an important part in any journey and I can surely say that I met some really good folks and learnt a lot from them. My friends have truly made this virtual college a lot more bearable as we shared our joys, pain and madness with each other. My batchmates have also been a bunch of lovely people and I was really amazed by the fact that even though we all are from such diverse backgrounds and cultures, we all relate to each other and truly enjoy each other’s company even though it may be from social media only. It is really unbelievable that we all haven’t met each other physically and yet we have formed such wonderful bonds. 
I hope the situation gets better soon and we are able to make some beautiful memories together and get the taste of the true college life!!
